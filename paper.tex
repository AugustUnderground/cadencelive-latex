smaller, if necessary. Figures, graphs, and photographs should be color or B\&W
of high quality, centered on the page. 

Figure, graph, photograph, and table captions should be Arial, 9pt, and
centered but not bolded, as presented below. The spacing for all captions: 3pt
before and 3pt after. The spacing for a a figure, graph, or photograph: 12pt

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \centering
    \caption{Measurement results}\label{tab:measure}
    \smallskip
        \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | } \hline
            \textbf{Voltage [V]} & \textbf{Current [A]} & \textbf{Frequency [Hz]} 
                & \textbf{Capacitance [nF]} & \textbf{Inductance [mH]} \\ 
            \hline
            1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 
            \hline 
        \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The caption is placed above the table and below the figure/graph/photograph. As
general rule, each figure/graph/photograph or table should occupy one-fourth to
one-third of a page.
